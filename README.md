# flappy-bird-clone

This is my attempt to re-create the famous flappy bird game. 

Gameplay Video:

Controls: Well it is simple, use the space bar to move the bird through gaps between pipes and score points for the same. 

Overall UI:

The features implemented here are:
1. The bird can be controlled using the space bar or the left mouse button.
2. Using the parallax effect, I have set up the different assets i.e. the background and the pipes.
3. The pipes get destroyed once it passes completely through the left of the screen.
4. I have implemented a collision for the bird using circle collider 2D.
